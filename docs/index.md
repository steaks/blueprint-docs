# Welcome to Blueprint
*The ergonomic web application framework*

Blueprint re-imagines web application architecture. It unifies server and frontend code so developers can build in a cohesive, declarative, and ergonomic code-base. Additionally, since all control-flow is encapsulated by Blueprint it creates a visual, interactive control-flow diagram to display the architecture of your application.

- **Cohesive - ** Build frontend and server code using the same style and system.
- **Declarative - ** Build declarative functions with complex control flows logic.
- **Ergonomic - ** Build code that matches your application flow. 

Get started by following this [tutorial](./gettingStarted.md) to build your first Blueprint web application.
